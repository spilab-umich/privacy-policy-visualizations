# pivacy-policy-visualizations


## Introduction
This github repo contains the necessary files to create interactive visualizations for privacy policy data for the Privaseer project.

**Current state**: Currently, the code can create very basic scatter plots plotting two variables (e.g., 'vagueness' on the y-axis and policy length on the x-axis). Each privacy policy is represented as one dot on that scatter plot. One can hover over the scatter plot to learn more details about the privacy policy, as well as click on the dot to visit the URL associated with that policy.

**Next Stepss** In the short term, we expect to add filtering functionality to scatter plots (for example, a user is able to select from a drop-down menu what industries of privacy policies they want to see.)

## Setup

### Python
This code runs on Python 3.10. To install Python, please follow the instructions on [this website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

### Python Packages
In addition to Python 3.10, this code makes use of the following packages: [holoviews](https://holoviews.org/), [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Instructions on how to install these packages can be found on their respective websites: having said that, all of these packages are available through [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), and so can be installed using the following commands:

> `pip install pandas`

> `pip install bokeh`

> `pip install holoviews`

## Running the code
To run the code, make sure that you have the files `visualization_data_industries.json` 
and `holoviewsscatterplotgenerator.py`. Using your termianl of choice, navigate into the directory where these files are located. Once there, run:

> `python holoviewsscatterplotgenerator.py`

`holoviewsscatterplotgenerator.py` will read in the data from `visualization_data_industries.json` and create two scatterplots, saving them in the directory `./holoviews_vis/` as `holoviews_length_vague.html` and `holoviews_length_vague_industry.html`. 


## Overview of Files
`visualization_data_industries.json` --> a json file containing Privaseer policy data in a dictionary of dictionaries format, similar to the following:

    {
        "58a055e3eb7477a963582952132965037ace7057": {
            "vague": "0.1506849315068493",
            "length": 1565,
            "url": "https://ithacaads.com/about-us/14042-privacy-policy",
            "readability": 14.0,
            "industry": "Unknown"
        },
        "2482f5b39109e0000b48a752937ac04150dedf9a": {
            "vague": "0.047619047619047616",
            "length": 463,
            "url": "https://legacyconsultinggroup.com/privacy-statement/",
            "readability": 13.5,
            "industry": "finance, marketing & human resources"
        },
    ...
    }


holoviewsscatterplotgenerator.py --> A python file that contains the code to generate the scatter plots. 

holoviews_vis --> A folder containing various visualizations generated by holoviewsscatterplootgenerator.py
